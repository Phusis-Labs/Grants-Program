## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

Phusis Labs seeks for next golden generation to lead the local community, working as a hub to connect Korea with the global ecosystem and onboard more young, new talents to the industry. We at Phusis have a mission to educate the next generations, who can stand firm unaffected by the market situations, who's primary concern stays in development, adoption and innovation rather than price speculation. Our members are true believers of the foundational changes blockchain will bring to the every aspect of the society, economy and the identity of human kind.
Phusis focuses on areas where it is necessary but not incentivized in terms of money. We focus on the core value of protocols, the necessity of the tools and environment and propagating the right vision for those who have will to learn.
With Web3 Foundation, we wish to build a better environment for local devs to better support decentralized web and our proposal is to translate the wikis and docs of substrate/polkadot in to Korean. Also we wish to create a tutorial for devs to onboard and a 101 for Polkadot in Korean for researchers to start dig in.
We believe that this will increase the awareness and the accessibility of the language and the product, eventually onbaording more studnet devs to the ecosystem. We are actively engaging with local universities, providing education and resources for them to learn and grow.
We're also building a student DAO, hopefully our translation can be a starting point for us to build a DAO with our own hands. We hope to receive an access to Substrate Builders Program, Grant Program Badge, and co-promotion. Would love to be connected with more student organizations worldwide.
